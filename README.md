This is a traffic light project made on an ATMEGA32A controller by Rene. There is connected 8 LEDs - traffic light, 1 speaker - for panic mode audio, 2 buttons - for input, 1 potentiometer - for volume, 1 contrast control - to change the LCD contrast.
If you press button 1, you can cross the road with the next cycle and the counter will count down to zero so that people can cross the road smoothly.
If you press the 2nd button, panic mode will be activated and all traffic lights will turn red and the buzzer will be activated for 10 sek.
